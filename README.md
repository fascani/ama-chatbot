# ama-chatbot

I created a "Ask Me Anything!" chatbot that can answer all kind of professional questions about my career, skills, values, etc. It runs on streamlit with a database on a Google sheet. As simple as that! The chatbot either uses OpenAI models via their API or Hugging Face's models run locally.
